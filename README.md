Further data of the project "1649 DDoS Protection System for Cloud: Architecture and Tool"

here we have the data packet of the scenario we tested with this pythoin code
we defined our method in both pyhton and bash
As here this is the primary idea to detect the ddos in tcp layer

Next Step is to setup a basic apache webserver and to onionize it.

Next need to setup the onion based ddos prevention, where we use techniques and tools provided by onion service itself to make a onion protection.

Next we have the list of tools to implement in both software adn hardware level to setup a defensive mechanism with features of
"detect","protect"&"recover" in a automated format
